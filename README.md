A simple Pomodoro Timer application built with .NET Core 3.1.

## How to Use
When starting, you will be asked to enter the name of your task. You will then go through 4 25-minute sprints with 3 5-minute breaks in between. After the 4th working phase, a longer 30-minute break will occur and the user has the choice to repeat the cycle or stop.
